# Visual Design

## Book

### Appearance

- Styled after a book
- Overlapping pieces of paper present information

### Navigation

- Buttons 'turn pages' navigating chronologically
- Chapters menu on left allows movement to sections

### Semantics

- Additional information is added using overlaid post-it notes
- Important text is highlighted or circled on the page

### Mobile

- On small screens only one page will be shown at a time, with two on larger screens
  - Pages cannot rely on being shown as a two-page spread
