# Dog CAL

## Introduction

This is a computer-assisted learning activity created to help familiarise you with different breeds of dog.

By the end of this activity, you will have read a little about every breed recognised by the Kennel Club and seen some accompanying pictures. You shouldn't aim to immediately memorise all the information provided here; focus on the most common breeds and refer back to this activity in the future for more specific information on lesser-known breeds.

Dog breeds can be divided into seven broad categories based on what purpose they were originally bred for. Each section in this activity will give some background information on a breed category and then list the dogs included in it.

## Hound

Hounds were originally bred to hunt. They are divided into sighthounds and scent hounds based on whether they hunt with sight and speed, or scent and endurance.

Common hounds include Beagles, Dachshunds, Greyhounds, and Whippets.

## Working

Working dogs were bred as guard dogs, or for search and rescue. Familiar working dog breeds are the Dobermann, Newfoundland, and Great Dane.

## Terrier

Terriers were originally bred to hunt vermin both above and below ground. Every terrier has "terrier" at the end of its name!

## Gundog

These were bred to help with shooting; either by finding live game or by retrieving shot and wounded animals.

## Pastoral

Pastoral dogs were bred to herd animals including sheep, cattle, and reindeer.

## Utility

The utility group contains breeds bred for a purpose not included in any of the other groups.

Toy breeds were bred as companion or lap dogs.
