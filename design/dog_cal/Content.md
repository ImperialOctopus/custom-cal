# Dog CAL

## Introduction

This is a computer-assisted learning activity created to help familiarise you with different breeds of dog.

By the end of this activity, you will have read a little about every breed recognised by the Kennel Club and seen some accompanying pictures. You shouldn't aim to immediately memorise all the information provided here; focus on the most common breeds and refer back to this activity in the future for more specific information on lesser-known breeds.

Dog breeds can be divided into seven broad categories based on what purpose they were originally bred for. Each section in this activity will give some background information on a breed category and then list the dogs included in it.
