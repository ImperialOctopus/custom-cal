# Dog CAL

## Introduction

This is a computer-assisted learning activity created to help familiarise you with different breeds of dog.

By the end of this activity, you will have read a little about every breed recognised by the Kennel Club and seen some accompanying pictures. You shouldn't aim to immediately memorise all the information provided here; focus on the most common breeds and refer back to this activity in the future for more specific information on lesser-known breeds.

Dog breeds can be divided into seven broad categories based on what purpose they were originally bred for. Each section in this activity will give some background information on a breed category and then list the dogs included in it.

## Hound

Hounds were originally bred to hunt. They are divided into sighthounds and scent hounds based on whether they hunt with sight and speed, or scent and endurance.

Common hounds include Beagles, Dachshunds, Greyhounds, and Whippets.

### Dachshund

Dachshunds have short legs and long bodies, bred to flush badgers and other burrowing animals out of their burrows. The miniature variety was used similarly to hunt rabbits and mice. Dachshunds have three coat varieties: smooth, wirehaired, and longhaired.

The normal size Dachshund is 20 to 22 cm tall. They have a life expectancy of around 12-16 years.

Although their name comes from German, modern Germans call this dog the Dackel or Teckel.

### Greyhound

Greyhounds were bred originally for hare coursing so have very long legs and a slim build to help them run fast (up to 40 mph) and corner sharply. Greyhound racing was introduced to the United States and United Kingdom in the 1920s.

They have short fur and come in a wide variety of colours.

## Working

Working dogs were bred as guard dogs, or for search and rescue. Familiar working dog breeds are the Dobermann, Newfoundland, and Great Dane.

### Dobermann

The Dobermann was created by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a German tax collector, to protect him while collecting in dangerous areas. Dobermanns were used by the United States during World War II, and work as guard dogs or personal protection dogs.

Dobermanns come in four colours: black, blue, red, and fawn.

### Great Dane

The Great Dane is a German breed originally created for hunting bears, boar, and deer. Both the tallest dog ever recorded and the tallest living dog are Great Danes.

## Terrier

Terriers were originally bred to hunt vermin both above and below ground. Every terrier has "terrier" at the end of its name! (Not every dog with "terrier" is a terrier though...)

### Scottish Terrier

The Scottish Terrier originates in Scotland as part of a group of highland terriers called the Skye Terriers. They were bred to hunt and fight badgers but throughout their history have been a popular pet breed.

They have a wiry outer coat covering a soft, dense undercoat. Their coats vary in colour from black through to white.

When the board game Monopoly was created, Scotties were among the most popular pets in the United States leading to their inclusion in the game as a player piece.

### Jack Russel Terrier

## Gundog

These were bred to help with shooting; either by finding live game or by retrieving shot and wounded animals.

### Labrador Retriever

### Cocker Spaniel

## Pastoral

Pastoral dogs were bred to herd animals including sheep, cattle, and reindeer.

### Border Collie

### Samoyed

## Utility

The utility group contains breeds bred for a purpose not included in any of the other groups.

### Bulldog

### Poodle

## Toy

Toy breeds were bred as companion or lap dogs.

### Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

### Pug
